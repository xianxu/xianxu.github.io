Being old fashioned, I always want simplicity and speed. That's why I use terminal and NeoVIM. Here's my setup on Mac. The key is I want to keep this deadly simple, thus when there are OK default, I would use that instead of heavily customize.

# TL:DR

I use the following. 

* `yadm` to track dotfiles, I treat this as a must.

# yadm

I started to use yadm to keep dotfiles in sync. yadm wraps around git and creates the illusion that some files and directories under `$HOME` are source controlled. Otherwise, it behaves just like `git`.

1. `brew install yadm`
2. `yadm clone ...` to clone your dotfiles repo. Or check [yadm manual](https://yadm.io/docs/getting_started) on how to initiate a repo from yadm. I'd suggest having a separate private GitHub repo to track your configuration files.
3. In the ideal case, that's all you need to do; you have recovered all the configuration files tracked by `yadm`!
4. To track a new file, it's simply something like: `yadm add ~/.zshrc`. You use `yadm status` to check what's changed. And `yadm commit; yadm push` to commit and push your changes to your repo on GitHub. It basically behaves the same as `git` command.

# Software on Mac

* Install [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com), which is vastly better than Terminal.app, especially if you need to connect to remote servers. Even just for local use, it's pretty good.
* Install [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com). I use the `1/` multi clipboard, `2/` global hot keys, and `3/` snippets (e.g. having quick access to ASCII art like `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`, for example).
* Use `zsh`, a modern shell.
* Use [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to customize your `zsh`. It adds all the cool bars and fonts here and there, and also much better command completion. It does all those largely out of the box.
* Install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/), which makes installing software on Mac much easier.
* You will need some fonts to display some weird Unicode codepoints. I use nerd fonts, in particular, `DejaVuSansMNerdFontPropo-Regular.ttf`.
* Install `NeoVIM`. If you use VIM at all, you should use NeoVIM. 
* `brew install ack`, `ack` is a much better grep.
