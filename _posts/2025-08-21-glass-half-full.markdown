Recently at work, I noticed some people complain a lot.  
Upon further inspection, it is affecting others on the team, as expected.  
I find it useful to write down my thoughts on this.  


In the end of the day, it is what type of person you want to be.  
Are you the glass half full type of person,  
Or your glass remains half empty?  


I think it is a very important choice.  
It is a fundamental choice.  
It affects you more in your life,  
Much more than in your work.  


So what’s the glass half full type of person about?  
As with everything in life, there are always two sides of a coin.  
Do you tend to see the positive side of things,  
Take comfort,  
So you have the stamina to keep going?  


Dwelling on the negative side of things,  
And complaining about it,  
While easy,  
Doesn’t make the problem go away.  


It’s probably also about maturity,  
About how you deal with problems in life.  
Once upon a time, when we were young, we complained.  
And our parents are the guarantors of our happiness.  
Being spoon-fed happiness this way,  
Maybe we never learn how to solve problems ourselves?  


Think about it.  
I think it is a very important choice.  
It is a fundamental choice.  
It affects your whole life,  
Much more than you know.
