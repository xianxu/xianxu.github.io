Recently at work, I noticed some people complain a lot.  
On closer look, it spreads,  
weighing on others, as expected.  
So I began writing down my thoughts.  


At the end of the day,  
it comes down to what kind of person you aspire to be.  
Do you gaze at a glass half full,  
or do you always see it half empty?  


I think it is a very important choice.  
It is a fundamental choice.  
It affects you more in your life,  
Much more than in your work.  


So what does it mean to live glass half full?  
Like every coin, there are two sides.  
Do you turn toward the brighter side,  
smile, take comfort where you can,  
and find the strength to carry on?  


Or do you see life through misery?  
Complaining feels easy,  
but it never solves a problem.  
And problems tend to grow larger,  
when you lack the will to face them.  


Itâ€™s probably also about maturity,  
About how you deal with life's problems.  
Once upon a time, when we were young, we complained.  
And our parents were the guarantors of our happiness.  
Being spoon-fed happiness this way,  
Maybe we never learned how to solve problems ourselves?  


Think about it.  
I think it is a very important choice.  
It is a fundamental choice.  
It affects your whole life,  
Much more than you know.
