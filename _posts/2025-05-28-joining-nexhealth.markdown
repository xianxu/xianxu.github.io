Have you ever thought about what it takes to build the infrastructure layer of the U.S. healthcare system, one that enables hundreds of different EHRs (Electronic Health Record systems), whether running in the cloud or under desks in doctors’ offices, to exchange health records seamlessly?

Imagine a future where patients can book and reschedule appointments as easily as work meetings, or seamlessly handled by your AI assistant; where ChatGPT can analyze your lab results and give second opinions on your X-rays; where you have a bird’s-eye view of your health over time, and AI agents monitor and flag preventable issues before they become serious. Intake forms are auto-filled because you’ve already submitted your data countless times. Your healthcare expenses are all in one place, organized, itemized, and easy to understand. And recruiting for clinical trials or tracking new drug effects becomes fast and frictionless.

**Software and AI are eating the world. It’s time they ate healthcare, too!**

This isn’t a pipe dream. At [NexHealth](https://www.nexhealth.com/), we’ve already started building that future. We’re on a mission to become the infrastructure layer for the entire healthcare system. Here’s our **three-step Master Plan**:

**Step One**: Connect enough EHRs in a single healthcare vertical to reach critical mass and create a thriving SaaS product that delivers real value to doctors. We’ve done this in the dental space and are now rapidly expanding into other elective care verticals.

**Step Two**: Open up this data connectivity to healthcare innovators, think of companies behind AI receptionist and new kinds of healthcare insurance product. We provide the integration infrastructure so they can focus on building the next generation of healthcare products and business models. That’s our API platform, and it’s gaining serious traction, signing up ever larger customers. 

**Step Three**: Continue integrating with more EHRs and attracting more developers to build on top of NexHealth, it's a virtuous cycle. On top of that platform, we’ll enable a marketplace powered by fully synchronized, well-organized healthcare data, to the benefit of everyone in the ecosystem:
* the doctors having an ever larger selection of apps to help all aspects of patient care and running their business.
* the app developers having access to ever larger amount of doctors and patients to scale their products.
* the patients having full control over their healthcare data, wherever they need them, no matter where they receive care. 

It’s a bold vision, and hard as hell to pull off. But that’s what makes it worth doing.

We’re hiring world-class engineers and leaders to help us get there. If you’re tired of optimizing click-through rates on social media platforms that are dumbing down the next generation, maybe it’s time to do something that matters.

Stop complaining about rising healthcare costs. Come help us build a future where healthcare actually works efficiently.

**WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE NOT AFRAID?**
