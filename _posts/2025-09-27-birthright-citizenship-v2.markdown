The Trump administration [appealed to the Supreme Court](https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/09/trump-urges-supreme-court-to-decide-whether-to-end-birthright-citizenship/), both on the merits and on further restriction of national injunctions yesterday (9/26). So after all, they are serious about the issue on the merits. That prompted me to look deeper, to go back to the original sources. My impression from contemporary news was that the merits were clear-cut against the administration. But after digging in, the result is more interesting than I expected. (Previous installment on this topic: [Birthright Citizenship](https://xianxu.github.io/2025/05/11/birthright-citizenship.html).)


### The Holding

Constitutional law 101: every case has a holding and dicta.

* Holding = the legal rule that is binding precedent, necessary to resolve the dispute, and applied to the material facts of the case.
* Dicta = commentary and reasoning by the judges. Dicta may be persuasive, but it is not binding.

And where do you find the holding in a ruling? It's not always easy, as it is almost never explicitly stated that "the holding is...". 

In [United States v. Wong Kim Ark](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/169/649/), the court held:

> *A child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but ave a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States, by virtue of the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution*. This, seems everyone agrees, that is the holding of the case.

The key phrase is "permanent domicil and residence in the United States". At the time, the Chinese Exclusion Act barred Chinese from naturalization but did allow permanent residence. Since Congress has express constitutional authority over naturalization, the Act was upheld as constitutional, however repugnant.

Read narrowly, the holding is:

1) Children born in the U.S.
2) To parents  who are legal permanent residents
3) Who are not diplomats
4) Are U.S. citizens

That means the holding does not cover the children of temporary visitors or of immigrants residing unlawfully. Then where all the broader interpretations come from?

### Dicta

The majority’s reasoning leaned heavily on the broader common law principle of jus soli: that almost everyone born on sovereign soil is a subject of that sovereign, except children of diplomats or invading armies. That’s much more expansive than the narrow holding.

### The Unique Case of Wong Kim Ark

So the holding is limited: children of legal permanent residents are citizens. But the dicta is broad: nearly everyone born in the U.S. is a citizen.

Here’s the twist: for 127 years, all branches of government have followed the dicta, not the holding. I haven’t found another Supreme Court case with such a long-lasting divergence!

Usually, when courts or executive branch overextend precedent, later courts correct it. But in this situation, no one has standing to sue. Why? Because it’s a broader benefit. Who is concretely harmed when more people are recognized as citizens? Almost nobody can show the "concrete and particularized injury" required to litigate, even if they want to. That’s why the dicta prevailed in practice.

### What's Standing?

Standing determines who can bring a case. It prevents courts from issuing advisory opinions, keeps them focused on live controversies, also lessen the case load on the court system. The Constitution’s "cases and controversies" clause is the basis for the justiciability doctrines, including standing.

In the context of birthright citizenship, nobody could show harm. Until now, because the government itself is trying to restrict it, creating many live controversies, and they got sued left and right.

### Reliance Interest

Another key principle is reliance interest: people order their lives around settled law, and courts are reluctant to disturb those settled expectations. Even wrongly decided precedents may be left standing if society has deeply relied on them.

Example:

* Roe v. Wade was overturned partly because reliance interests were weaker; people can, at least going forward, plan around reproductive choices differently.
* In contrast, Obergefell (same-sex marriage) created reliance interests in property, inheritance, adoption, and more, thus going to be much harder to unwind.

Birthright citizenship is also deeply entrenched, after all, it is the practice of 127 years! But you can also argue that the reliance interest is weaker than Obergefell, because it is not about existing relationships, but future ones, of people who does not exist yet... 

### Prediction of the Outcome of Birthright Citizenship Case

This may be the blockbuster case of the century. My best guess, given the Court’s current philosophy:

1. **Trump’s Executive Order struck down**: The Court rules it exceeds executive authority under the “major questions” doctrine. Reliance interests strengthen this conclusion. (Conservatives and liberals both have reasons to agree here.)

2. **Holding of Wong Kim Ark reaffirmed**: That children of legal permanent residents are citizens. They don't need to do this to reach conclusion but I think they may reaffirm the holding gives a nod to stare decisis and bolsters legitimacy. 

3. **Signal to Congress**: The Court may hint that Congress, not the President, may attempt to regulate birthright citizenship for non-permanent residents. Depending on tone, even liberal justices may join for unanimity optics. I'm quite sure such would appear in some form in dicta.

4. **No change on national injunctions**: Since the executive order itself is struck down, the lower courts’ nationwide injunctions appear justified. The Court likely avoids narrowing that tool here.
