I love trees despite my allergy, which is poetic. Surprisingly, on a recent trip to Phoenix, I realized I also love the desert. Strange as it is. Spring in Phoenix, with its gorgeous Palo Verde trees, mesmerizes. Here are some [pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2RZWUbtvC6wL5tEy8)! 

This is also the first time I found glued to my Leica Q2, it finally feels like a glove. The key draw to me is the combination of a small package, a fast lens, and the ability to shoot manually. It offers just the right assistance to make manual shooting a pleasant experience. The availability of physical dials and lens rings allows me to pre-set the correct setting before shooting, making photography a more intimate experience.
