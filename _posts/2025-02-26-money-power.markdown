# Happiness @ Work: Money, Power and the Rest

  *Reflection from a Silicon Valley insider*

Consider things that make you happy. In your pursuit of happiness at work, be it picking a career, or changing a team, or a company, consider the following: `money`, `power`, `domain`, `people`, and `growth`. Not in particular order. 


## Money, obviously important. 

This does not matter for internal transfers, as it's often lateral moves. 

Looking outside in Silicon Valley, people fantasize about startups and sudden riches. On the other hand, statistically speaking, the few top tech companies often pay better expected value. Think about your whole family situation. Does your spouse bring in big checks? How stable are their jobs? 

For people with the benefit of a good cushion, remember to ask: what would you do if you were not afraid (about money)? 

There’s also the famous saying that when offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don't ask what seat. 


## Power, the sense of control. 

How much influence do you have in an organization, and across the company? 

How much autonomy do you have working on things you enjoy? 


## Domain, the type of things we work on. 

We are technologists, we need to be intrigued and passionate about the domain you are in. You can only excel in this pursuit, if you are passionate about what you do, always curious to learn more, and having an opinion on how to go about it. One of the yardstick I'd use, is to ask yourself, do you watch Tiktok video in your spare time, or do you read technological news and papers.


## People, while a cliche, but it’s really all about people. 

Even truer, is people stay and leave for their managers. 

How are your key partners? Do you admire them, as a professional and as a person? Do you learn from them?

Do you have a strong trust circle to weather inevitable storms? 

This is also what makes leaving a company you stayed for a long time hard, as there's simply few ways to know the people you are going to work with from interviews alone. Culture, can be a generic barometer. 


## Growth, a sense of progress. 

Are you learning? Can be anything, technology, soft skills, organization intrigues. Are you gaining the experience you want? 

Is your organization's mission exciting and inspiring, that you can learn and become a better version of yourself?


## And one last thing: Are You Having Fun at Work?!
