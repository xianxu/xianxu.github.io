Being old fashioned, you'd always want simplicity and speed. Here's my setup on Mac.

## On mac

* First install font on mac, basically to display some symbols used in various plugins. I found [nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#patched-fonts) patch alright. 
  * Download directly from Releases [ryanoasis/nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases). I used *DejaVuSansMNerdFontPropo-Regular.ttf*.
